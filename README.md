# GM Research Crawler (Version 2)
## Quantitative Analysis of Fast Fashion and Slow Fashion Website Design Elements Using a Web Crawler

### Objective
This research aims to answer the guiding question: are there explicit differences in the website design & components of a fast fashion website compared to a slow fashion website? 

A web crawler will be utilized to scrape data from fast fashion and slow fashion websites. For example, number of product collections, amount of products displayed per page, and mention of sustainability certifications. This data will then be analyzed using uni and multivariate statistical tests, possibly also including data analytics such as multivariate clustering methods, to determine if there are significant patterns and/or explicit differences between the two types of websites.
